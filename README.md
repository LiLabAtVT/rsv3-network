# rsv3-network
rsv3 response networks

The code in this pipeline was used to reconstruct the gene regulatory network of the Rsv3-mediated extreme resistance response to soybean mosaic virus. Input data was time series gene expression data. Pipeline begins with raw sequencing data and proceeds through inference of putative regulatory interactions between transcription factor genes and target genes.
